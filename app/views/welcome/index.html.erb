<p>This is just some dummy text for the client lounge home page, at the moment the project is not complete if you are looking at this. Soon there will be heaps of features.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why I am doing this, it is because I want an easy way to manage my clients online and give them access where they can download their projects. I am a freelancer undertaking web and simple graphic design and often find myself having to email and re-email items and upload them without structure.</p>
<p>I am aware that there are already a number of solutions out there but I really wanted one that I could customise myself, so I started from scratch to suit my workflow. I am open to any feature suggestions and recommendations that anyone with previous experience can offer.</p>
